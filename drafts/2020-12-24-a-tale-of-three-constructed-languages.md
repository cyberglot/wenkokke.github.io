title: A Tale of Three Constructed Languages
---

Today, we’re gonna talk about *conlangs*! Conlang is short for *constructed language*. There’s a bunch of famous conlangs. [Esperanto][esperanto] is probably the most famous of the idealistic “let’s unite the world” conlangs—it’s pretty old, going back to the late 1870s. In the 1930s, some dude named Jerry Tolkien published a whole series of fantasy novels just to popularise [[z$5h#]{.font-tengwar}][quenya][^quenya] and his other conlangs, an effort we can say was at least passably successful. In recent decades, we got [tlhIngan Hol][klingon], [lekh dothraki][dothraki] and [Valyrio udrir][valyrian], each of which now have communities of speakers formed around them. Heck, two of those even got their’s own [DuoLingo][klingon-duolingo] [course][valyrian-duolingo]![^ads] Unfortunately, one thing all these languages share is that they were created by dudes…

Historically, conlanging has been *a wee bit* dominated by clueless wealthy white dudes trying to find *the perfect language*.[^white-dudes] My favourite example of this is [Solrésol][solresol], designed by François Sudre in 1827. François tried to create a language using only the symbols [do]{.solresol-red}, [re]{.solresol-orange}, [mi]{.solresol-yellow}, [fa]{.solresol-green}, [sol]{.solresol-cyan}, [la]{.solresol-blue}, and [si]{.solresol-magenta} or [ti]{.solresol-magenta}, in hopes that it could be spoken, painted, played, or whistled—it’s possible he, *uh*, “took a little inspiration from” one of the many natural [whistled languages][whistled-languages], which are predominantly from Africa and the Americas. Anyway, he’s got this *seven sounds* premise, and immediately sets out to create a “taxonomy of all meaning” using only these seven sounds—*e.g.*, all words starting with [sol]{.solresol-cyan} pertain to the arts or sciences, famously one of the seven core categories of meaning. He follows that up with the *totally compatible* constraint that reversing a word should invert its meaning—*e.g.*, [fa]{.solresol-green}[la]{.solresol-blue} means *good*, and [la]{.solresol-blue}[fa]{.solresol-green} means *bad*. Presumably, *good* relates to country and war, and *bad* is primarily used in industry and commerce? Entirely in character, he tries to sell his language to the army, recommending they use Solrésol to transmit messages using, *like*, a trumpet, and when that turns out not to work, he tries to sell them some *musical canons*.

Much as I *love* roasting Solrésol, that’s not what this blog post is about! Today, I figured I’d talk about some conlangs which were made by women![^overwhelming-whiteness]


# Lingua Ignota<br />*by St. Hildegaard von Bingen*

<img alt="A bronze statue of St. Hildegard von Bingen." src="/public/images/hildegard-1.jpg" />

Lingua Ignota is the earliest conlang that we know about! It was created by St. Hildegard von Bingen in the 12^th^ century. Hildegard was pretty impressive, to say the least. These days, she’s mostly known for her music—she’s blowing up [on Spotify!][hildegard-spotify]—but she also founded two monasteries, wrote poetry and plays, texts on theology, botany, medicine, *etc.*, and addition to *all this*, she constructed a language, *Lingua Ignota*. She did all this in a time where it wasn’t particularly common for women to write, let alone *create language*, an act which was either “demonized [or] divinized” [@Higley2007].

Hildegard was canonised as a saint by the Catholic Church, so I guess the pendulum swung closer to “divinized” in her case. This makes her an obvious pick for patron saint of conlangs![^patron-saints] A golden reliquary [in Eibingen][eibingen-abbey] stores her relics: her heart and, fittingly, her tongue!

Hildegard introduced Lingua Ignota in a manuscript titled *Ignota Lingua per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata*, or “An unknown language brought forward by the simple human being Hildegard.” Throughout her writing, Hildegard refers to herself as a “simple human” and a “poor little womanly shape”, and emphasises that her achievements are *really* those of God, and that she is merely a vessel. Such repeated self-deprecatory remarks have led to an image of Hildegard as “simple, humble, stumbling, [and] requiring help from her male advisers.” Much more likely, however, is that it was her emphasis on her lowliness which allowed her to get away with such great achievements![^higley]

Lingua Ignota is based on Latin. It consists of a glossary of nouns and adjectives to be used in Latin sentences. There are 1011 surviving glosses, preserved via the [Riesencodex][riesencodex] (fol. 461^a^) and the Berliner Handschrift (Lat. Quart. 4º 674). Interestingly, the glossary in the Riesencodex is not in any alphabetical order. Rather, it is in order of hierarchy—God, angels, saints, *etc.* There is only one surviving text written in Lingua Ignota, “O orzchis Ecclesia”, found *twice* in the Riesencodex (fol. 472^a^ and 405^a^):

> O [orzchis]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es [caldemia]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} stigmatum [loifolum]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam [crizanta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} in alto sono, et es [chorzta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gemma.

The text contains only five foreign words, of which only one is glossed in the Riesencodex—*loifolum* is the genitive of *loifol*, “people”, but @Higley2007 conjectures that *crizanta* means “annointed” and is the past participle of *crizia*, “church”, and that *orzchis* means “great” as used in the compound word *orschibuz*, “oak tree”. She conjectures the following translation of the text:

| Lingua Ignota                                                 | English
| ---                                                           | ---
| O [orzchis]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Ecclesia                | O [immense]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Church
| armis divinis praecincta                                      | girded by divine arms
| et hyacinto ornata                                            | and ornamented in jacinth!
| tu es [caldemia]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}                    | Thou art the [fragrance]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}
| stigmatum [loifolum]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}                | of the wounds [of peoples]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}
| et urbs scienciarum.                                          | and the city of knowledge.
| O, o tu es etiam [crizanta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}         | O, o, thou art also [anointed]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}
| in alto sono et es [chorzta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gemma. | in sounds on high and art a [glittering]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gem.

The fact that only *one* of the foreign words in “O orzchis Ecclesia” is actually glossed in the Riesencodex hints at the possibility that Lingua Ignota may have been a much larger language! Personally, I like to imagine Hildegard using her unknown language to write down her thoughts and keep notes, though there is *zero evidence* for this. But you know what there’s *tonnes* of? Disagreement as to *what purpose* Lingua Ignota served to Hildegard:

- Folks have called it an enigmatic code—but that’s rather unlikely, since she *literally* wrote a letter to the pope to brag about it. Good on her!
- Folks have compared it to glossolalia—which is like scat singing, but you pretend you’re speaking a divine language.
- Folks have suggested that Hildegard was inspired by Adam’s language in Paradise, but that since she did not consider herself a capable linguist, she settled for creating something to replace Latin.
- *Etc.*

Unfortunately, we probably don’t have enough surviving evidence to ever really answer this question. However, @Higley2007 makes a compelling argument that Lingua Ignota *isn’t* a glossolalia. Where others saw recurring syllables, “as if an obsessive leitmotif”, she argues that these are *compound words*. For instance, take *-buz*, which recurs frequently between glosses 750–800:

| Lingua Ignota | English      | Lingua Ignota | English
| ---           | ---          | ---           | ---
| Scoibuz       | boxwood      | Laschiabuz    | mountain ash
| Gramzibuz     | chestnut     | Sparinichibuz | peach tree
| Zaimzabuz     | quince       | Zirunzibuz    | pear tree
| Grumzimbuz    | cherry tree  | Burzimibuz    | plum tree
| Culmendiabuz  | dogwood      | Scinzibuz     | savin
| Guskaibuz     | winter oak   | Kisanzibuz    | cotton tree
| Gigunzibuz    | fig tree     | Ornalzibuz    | sanguinaria
| Scongilbuz    | spindle tree | Vischobuz     | yew
| Clamizibuz    | laurel       | Gulizb[a]z    | birch
| Zaschibuz     | mastic       | Scuanibuz     | myrtle
| Schalnihilbuz | juniper      | Schirobuz     | maple
| Mizamabuz     | mulberry     | Orschibuz     | oak
| Burschiabuz   | tamarisk     | Muzimibuz     | walnut

Clearly, *-buz* means “bush” or “tree”, and they’re all clustered together because trees and bushes are all at approximately the same level in Hildegard’s hierarchy of the holy. In fact, @Higley2007 finds a bunch more suffixes and compound words, such as *phazur*, “grandfather”, and *kulzphazur*, “ancestor”.

Hildegard also introduced a script, *Litteræ Ignotæ*, printed in the Riesencodex (fol. 464^a^). Unfortunately, there are no surviving texts which use it, but I’ve rendered “O orzchis Ecclesia” in Litteræ Ignotæ below:

::: {.font-litterae-ignotae .x-large}
> O [orzchis]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es [caldemia]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} stigmatum [loifolum]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam [crizanta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} in alto sono, et es [chorzta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gemma.
:::

When I saw Litteræ Ignotæ, my first thought was “I *have to* make a font for this!”, but fortunately, someone had already done that for me!

# Láadan<br />*by Suzette Haden Elgin*

- *Created by* Suzette Haden Elign *ca.* 1985
- *Rules for* phonology*,* morphology*,* grammar*, etc.*
- *Glossary of* 1000 words *with ways to* create new words
- *Offered within a* work of fiction*: Native Tongue*
- *Meant to* test a socio-linguistic hypothesis
- *Within the framework of the* Sapir-Whorf *hypothesis*
- Suzette had a Ph.D. in Linguistics, writing two dissertations: one on English, one on Navajo.
- Here's something infuriating to anyone *not* born in the 1930s:
  Suzette started writing Science Fiction to pay her tuition.
- Hypothesis: Existing human languages are inadequate to express the perceptions of women
- A Thought Experiment:
  1. *the* Sapir-Whorf *hypothesis is true*
  2. *existing languages are* inadequate for women
  3. *change in* language brings societal change
  4. *when offered a women's language:*
     + *women will* adopt it *or;*
     + *women will* create a better language
- Problems with English:
  + words obscure imperfection
    *their meaning does not conform to the reality perceived by women*
  + words are insufficiently nuanced
    *their meaning glosses over a vast range of distinct female experiences*
  + *there is* too much potential for misunderstanding
- The problem is natural languages lack vocabulary for many things that are extremely important to women, making it cumbersome and inconvenient to talk about them. 
- Furthermore, they lack ways to express emotional information conveniently. Much of that information had to be carried by body language and was almost entirely missing from written language. This leaves women vulnerable to hostile language followed by the “But all I said was….” excuse; and it restricted women to the largely useless “It wasn’t what you said, it was the way you said it!” defense against such hostility.

- Illustrates English vocabulary being deceitful, and obscuring imperfection.
- Defined negatively, in terms of what they are supposed to be, but they are not, in an attempt to amend the way English does not match the way reality is perceived by Elgin and the women she interviewed.

| bara   | *anger* with reason, with someone to blame, which is futile        |
| bana   | *anger* with reason, with no one to blame, which is futile         |
| bama   | *anger* with reason, but with no one to blame, which is not futile |
| bina   | *anger* with no reason, with no one to blame, which is not futile  |
| bala   | *anger* with reason, with someone to blame, which is not futile    |

- Illustrates English vocabulary not being nuanced enough.

| *wa*    | *what I’m saying is true because* I have perceived it |
| *wi*    | *what I’m saying is true because* it’s self-evident   |

- Illustrates English being too imprecise when it comes to emotional information.
- A Brief Feminist Critique of Láadan
  + based on the experiences of Suzette
    *and the women whom she consulted*
  + copies over societal taboos
    *e.g. has no more nuanced words for sex*
  + assumes traditional model of sex and gender:
    - *assumes* sex is binary
    - *assumes* gender is binary, immutable, determined by sex
