title: A Tale of Three Constructed Languages
---

Today, we’re gonna talk about *conlangs*! Conlang is short for *constructed language*. There’s a bunch of famous conlangs. [Esperanto][esperanto] is probably the most famous of the idealistic “let’s unite the world” conlangs—it’s pretty old, going back to the late 1870s. In the 1930s, some dude named Jerry Tolkien published a whole series of fantasy novels just to popularise [[z$5h#]{.font-tengwar}][quenya][^quenya] and his other conlangs, an effort we can say was at least passably successful. In recent decades, we got [tlhIngan Hol][klingon], [lekh dothraki][dothraki] and [Valyrio udrir][valyrian], each of which now have communities of speakers formed around them. Heck, two of those even got their’s own [DuoLingo][klingon-duolingo] [course][valyrian-duolingo]![^ads] Unfortunately, one thing all these languages share is that they were created by dudes…

<!--more-->

Historically, conlanging has been *a wee bit* dominated by clueless wealthy white dudes trying to find *the perfect language*.[^white-dudes] My favourite example of this is [Solrésol][solresol], designed by François Sudre in 1827. François tried to create a language using only the symbols [do]{.solresol-red}, [re]{.solresol-orange}, [mi]{.solresol-yellow}, [fa]{.solresol-green}, [sol]{.solresol-cyan}, [la]{.solresol-blue}, and [si]{.solresol-magenta} or [ti]{.solresol-magenta}, in hopes that it could be spoken, painted, played, or whistled—it’s possible he, *uh*, “took a little inspiration from” one of the many natural [whistled languages][whistled-languages], which are predominantly from Africa and the Americas. Anyway, he’s got this *seven sounds* premise, and immediately sets out to create a “taxonomy of all meaning” using only these seven sounds—*e.g.*, all words starting with [sol]{.solresol-cyan} pertain to the arts or sciences, famously one of the seven core categories of meaning. He follows that up with the *totally compatible* constraint that reversing a word should invert its meaning—*e.g.*, [fa]{.solresol-green}[la]{.solresol-blue} means *good*, and [la]{.solresol-blue}[fa]{.solresol-green} means *bad*. Presumably, *good* relates to country and war, and *bad* is primarily used in industry and commerce? Entirely in character, he tries to sell his language to the army, recommending they use Solrésol to transmit messages using, *like*, a trumpet, and when that turns out not to work, he tries to sell them some *musical canons*.

Much as I *love* roasting Solrésol, that’s not what this blog post is about! Today, I figured I’d talk about some conlangs which were made by women![^overwhelming-whiteness]


# Lingua Ignota<br />*by St. Hildegaard von Bingen*

<img alt="A bronze statue of St. Hildegard von Bingen." src="/public/images/hildegard.jpg" />

Lingua Ignota is the earliest conlang that we know about! It was created by St. Hildegard von Bingen in the 12^th^ century. Hildegard was pretty impressive, to say the least. These days, she’s mostly known for her music—she’s blowing up [on Spotify!][hildegard-spotify]—but she also founded two monasteries, wrote poetry and plays, texts on theology, botany, medicine, *etc.*, and addition to *all this*, she constructed a language, *Lingua Ignota*. She did all this in a time where it wasn’t particularly common for women to write, let alone *create a language*, an act which was either “demonized [or] divinized” [@Higley2007].

Hildegard was canonised as a saint by the Catholic Church, so I guess the pendulum swung closer to “divinized” in her case. This makes her an obvious pick for patron saint of conlangs![^patron-saints] A golden reliquary [in Eibingen][eibingen-abbey] stores her relics: her heart and, fittingly, her tongue!

Hildegard introduced Lingua Ignota in a manuscript titled *Ignota Lingua per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata*, or “An unknown language brought forward by the simple human being Hildegard.” Throughout her writing, Hildegard refers to herself as a “simple human” and a “poor little womanly shape”, and emphasises that her achievements are *really* those of God, and that she is merely a vessel. Such repeated self-deprecatory remarks have led to an image of Hildegard as “simple, humble, stumbling, [and] requiring help from her male advisers.” Much more likely, however, is that it was her emphasis on her lowliness which allowed her to get away with such great achievements![^higley]

Lingua Ignota is based on Latin. It consists of a glossary of nouns and adjectives to be used in Latin sentences. There are 1011 surviving glosses, preserved via the [Riesencodex][riesencodex] (fol. 461^a^) and the Berliner Handschrift (Lat. Quart. 4º 674). Interestingly, the glossary in the Riesencodex is not in any alphabetical order. Rather, it is in order of hierarchy—God, angels, saints, *etc.* There is only one surviving text written in Lingua Ignota, “O orzchis Ecclesia”, found *twice* in the Riesencodex (fol. 472^a^ and 405^a^):

> O [orzchis]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es [caldemia]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} stigmatum [loifolum]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam [crizanta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} in alto sono, et es [chorzta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gemma.

The text contains only five foreign words, of which only one is glossed in the Riesencodex—*loifolum* is the genitive of *loifol*, “people”, but @Higley2007 conjectures that *crizanta* means “annointed” and is the past participle of *crizia*, “church”, and that *orzchis* means “great” as used in the compound word *orschibuz*, “oak tree”. She conjectures the following translation of the text:

| Lingua Ignota                                                 | English
| ---                                                           | ---
| O [orzchis]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Ecclesia                | O [immense]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Church
| armis divinis praecincta                                      | girded by divine arms
| et hyacinto ornata                                            | and ornamented in jacinth!
| tu es [caldemia]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}                    | Thou art the [fragrance]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}
| stigmatum [loifolum]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}                | of the wounds [of peoples]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}
| et urbs scienciarum.                                          | and the city of knowledge.
| O, o tu es etiam [crizanta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}         | O, o, thou art also [anointed]{.lingua-ignota-highlight}
| in alto sono et es [chorzta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gemma. | in sounds on high and art a [glittering]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gem.

The fact that only *one* of the foreign words in “O orzchis Ecclesia” is actually glossed in the Riesencodex hints at the possibility that Lingua Ignota may have been a much larger language! Personally, I like to imagine Hildegard using her unknown language to write down her thoughts and keep notes, though there is *zero evidence* for this. But you know what there’s *tonnes* of? Disagreement as to *what purpose* Lingua Ignota served to Hildegard:

- Folks have called it an enigmatic code—but that’s rather unlikely, since she *literally* wrote a letter to the pope to brag about it. Good on her!
- Folks have compared it to glossolalia—which is like scat singing, but you pretend you’re speaking a divine language.
- Folks have suggested that Hildegard was inspired by Adam’s language in Paradise, but that since she did not consider herself a capable linguist, she settled for creating something to replace Latin.
- *Etc.*

Unfortunately, we probably don’t have enough surviving evidence to ever really answer this question. However, @Higley2007 makes a compelling argument that Lingua Ignota *isn’t* a glossolalia. Where others saw recurring syllables, “as if an obsessive leitmotif”, she argues that these are *compound words*. For instance, take *-buz*, which recurs frequently between glosses 750–800:

| Lingua Ignota | English      | Lingua Ignota | English
| ---           | ---          | ---           | ---
| Scoibuz       | boxwood      | Laschiabuz    | mountain ash
| Gramzibuz     | chestnut     | Sparinichibuz | peach tree
| Zaimzabuz     | quince       | Zirunzibuz    | pear tree
| Grumzimbuz    | cherry tree  | Burzimibuz    | plum tree
| Culmendiabuz  | dogwood      | Scinzibuz     | savin
| Guskaibuz     | winter oak   | Kisanzibuz    | cotton tree
| Gigunzibuz    | fig tree     | Ornalzibuz    | sanguinaria
| Scongilbuz    | spindle tree | Vischobuz     | yew
| Clamizibuz    | laurel       | Gulizb[a]z    | birch
| Zaschibuz     | mastic       | Scuanibuz     | myrtle
| Schalnihilbuz | juniper      | Schirobuz     | maple
| Mizamabuz     | mulberry     | Orschibuz     | oak
| Burschiabuz   | tamarisk     | Muzimibuz     | walnut

Clearly, *-buz* means “bush” or “tree”, and they’re all clustered together because trees and bushes are all at approximately the same level in Hildegard’s hierarchy of the holy. In fact, @Higley2007 finds a bunch more suffixes and compound words, such as *phazur*, “grandfather”, and *kulzphazur*, “ancestor”.

Hildegard also introduced a script, *Litteræ Ignotæ*, printed in the Riesencodex (fol. 464^a^). Unfortunately, there are no surviving texts which use it, but I’ve rendered “O orzchis Ecclesia” in Litteræ Ignotæ below:

::: {.font-litterae-ignotae .x-large}
> O [orzchis]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es [caldemia]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} stigmatum [loifolum]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam [crizanta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} in alto sono, et es [chorzta]{.lingua-ignota-highlight} gemma.
:::

When I saw Litteræ Ignotæ, my first thought was “I *have to* make a font for this!”, but fortunately, someone had already done that for me!

# Láadan<br />*by Suzette Haden Elgin*

<img alt="A crop of the cover for Native Tongue by Suzette Haden Elgin." src="/public/images/native-tongue.png" />

Láadan was created by Suzette Haden Elgin in 1982. Suzette had a Ph.D. in linguistics, and wrote *two* theses—one on English, one on Navajo—so she was well-equipped to create a language. Láadan is—*ugh, I swear there’s a word for this*…—let’s go with *philosophical*. It’s a *philosophical* language, which is when you have a neat idea, and you use it to guide your language design. For Láadan, Suzette had the following idea:

1. Let’s assume the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis][sapir-whorf] is true, and the language you speak *really does* affect how you view the world!
2. Natural languages, such as English, tend to be male-centred, and are very bad at capturing the experiences of women.
3. If you change the language, you change how people see the world, and societal change will follow!

*Therefore*: if you offer women a *women’s language*, they will adopt it, or at very least see that this is something that’d been missing from their lives and create a better language for women. And voilà, societal change follows! At least, that was her hope, and the hypothesis she wanted to test by creating Láadan.

What problems did she see with English, exactly?

- Natural languages often lack the vocabulary for things that are *extremely important* to women, making it difficult to talk about them. Either:
  + words *obscure imperfections*, and their meaning does not conform to the reality perceived by women; or
  + words are *insufficiently nuanced*, and their meaning glosses over a vast range of distinct experiences.
- Natural languages have *too much potential for misunderstanding*, which can and often is *weaponized* against women.

*First*: Suzette felt that English words often disguise imperfections. Let’s look at the following Láadan words, which can hopefully help illustrate that point a bit:

| Láadan        | English
| ---           | ---
| *radíidin*    | non-holiday, holiday more work that it’s worth, a time allegedly a holiday but actually so much a burden because of work and preparations that it is a dreaded occasion; especially when there are too many guests and none of them help
| *rathóo*      | non-guest, someone who comes to visit knowing perfectly well that they are intruding and causing difficulty

These words are defined *negatively*, in terms of what they’re supposed to be, but *aren’t*—the common meanings of “holiday” and “guest” gloss over these experiences, as they’re only associated with happy experiences! “It’s a holiday! Let’s invite over all our friends! Yummy food for everyone!”

*Next Up*: Suzette felt that English words are often *insufficiently nuanced*, glossing over *very different* experiences. Let’s look at the Láadan words for menstruation:

| Láadan      | English
| ---         | ---
| *osháana*   | menstruate
| *elasháana* | menstruate for the first time
| *zhesháana* | menstruate in sync with another woman
| *husháana*  | menstruate painfully
| *desháana*  | menstruate early
| *wesháana*  | menstruate late
| *ásháana*   | menstruate joyfully

Those can all be *heckin’ different* experiences, and English just kinda lumps them all together in a single word! Mind you, that doesn’t mean you *can’t express* these differences in English—you clearly can, just look at the glossary above—but it *does* mean you have to put *a bunch of effort* into clarifying!

A distinction that I’ve actually found *really useful* for clarifying my own thoughts are those for *emotions*. Let’s have a look at the Láadan words for anger:

| Láadan | English
| ---    | ---
| *bara* | anger with reason, with someone to blame, which is futile
| *bala* | anger with reason, with someone to blame, which is not futile
| *bana* | anger with reason, with no one to blame, which is futile
| *bama* | anger with reason, with no one to blame, which is not futile
| *bina* | anger with no reason, with no one to blame, which is not futile

Láadan distinguishes between types of anger with or without reason, with or without someone to blame, and whether the anger is futile or not!

*Finally*: Suzette felt that English has too much potential for misunderstanding. For instance, English doesn’t usually carry emotional information *explicitly*. Rather, it is carried by body language and intonation. That leaves women vulnerable to hostile language followed by the “But all I said was…” excuse, and restricts women to the “It wasn’t *what* you said, it was *the way you said it*!” defence. Suzette addresses this by introducing *speech-act* particles and *evidentials*.

The speech-act particles tell you whether the sentence is meant as a statement, a question, a command, a promise, a warning, a joke, *etc*:

| Láadan  | English
| ---     | ---
| *bíi*   | I say to you as a statement
| *báa*   | I say to you as a question
| *bíid*  | I say to you in anger
| *bíida* | I say to you in jest

The evidence particles tell you the source and trustworthiness of the statement:

| Láadan  | English
| ---     | ---
| *wa*    | what I’m saying is true because I have perceived it
| *wi*    | what I’m saying is true because it’s self-evident
| *wáa*   | what I’m saying is true because it comes from a trusted source
| *wóo*   | I have no idea whether or not what I’m saying is true

These evidence particles were likely taken from Navajo. Other aspects of Láadan, such as its tonality, were likely inspired by Navajo as well. 

Unlike Lingua Ignota—or what survives of it, at least—Láadan is a full-fledged language! There’s rules for phonology, tonality, morphology, grammar, *etc.* When Láadan was first introduced, it came with a glossary of *one thouseand* words, but also had rules for constructing new words. It’s hard to guess how many Láadan words are in use at the moment, but, *e.g.*, the [Láadan Vocabulary][laadan-memrise] course on Memrise has close to *twice as many*.

Suzette offered her language to the world in the form of a work of fiction. She wrote a book, *Native Tongue*, in which she motivates the need for Láadan. Her story is set in a world in which women have been stripped of their rights and their agency, and her story follows the liberating effects of being able to clearly communicate ones experiences in a language *made for you*. Native Tongue gives a vivid portrayal of sexism, but it *kind of* glances over liberation through language—that a change in language brings about a change in society is simply one of the axioms of the story, it’s just something that *happens*. Unfortunately, I did not come away from reading Native Tongue with an understanding of Láadan, as there are only *two Láadan words* used in the book itself—and one of them is *Láadan*! (The other word is *héenahal*, or “siblings of the heart to an unusual degree”, which is what women will be to each other if they’re allowed to speak Láadan amongst themselves.)

The book itself is a pretty good read! Suzette was already an experienced author when she wrote it, and she’d already been publishing for over a *decade*! Here’s a little fact that’ll infuriate anyone under forty: *Suzette first started writing science fiction to pay her tuition!*

Let’s end with *a brief feminist critique* of Láadan. Suzette constructed Láadan based on her own experiences and those of a handful of women whom she consulted. I’ll assume, *recklessly*, that means it was largely based on the experiences of white, Christian, well-to-do women, and I feel it shows:

- Láadan copies over societal taboos. For instance, it has no more nuance words for sex—it has *shim* for “sex”, and *lila* for “lesbian sex”, but nothing more specific than that.

- Láadan gives us no vocabulary for the indignities of poverty, not even for those suffered largely by women. For instance, it has no word for when you can’t afford pads and have to use, *e.g.*, bits of cloth instead.

- Láadan assumes a colonial model of sex and gender—it assumes sex is binary, and gender is binary, immutable, and determined by sex—and has *really* taken gender essentialism to heart. Hell, the story is basically feminist separatist propaganda! It ends with women and men living separately, which is hailed by both as a wondrous solution!  Even in its grammatical gender it only has female and male—it may be *female-default*, but that’s such a *second-wave* idea of progress.

I’d say Láadan is a deeply flawed experiment, but I’m still, *uh*, what’s the word?
