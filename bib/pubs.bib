@ARTICLE{KokkeMW20:cpnd-ext,
  abstract   = {Process calculi based in logic, such as ùúãDILL and CP, provide a
                  foundation for deadlock-free concurrent programming, but
                  exclude non-determinism and races. HCP is a reformulation of
                  CP which addresses a fundamental shortcoming: the fundamental
                  operator for parallel composition from the ùúã-calculus does not
                  correspond to any rule of linear logic, and therefore not to
                  any term construct in CP. We introduce non-deterministic HCP,
                  which extends HCP with a novel account of non-determinism. Our
                  approach draws on bounded linear logic to provide a
                  strongly-typed account of standard process calculus
                  expressions of non-determinism. We show that our extension is
                  expressive enough to capture many uses of non-determinism in
                  untyped calculi, such as non-deterministic choice, while
                  preserving HCP's meta-theoretic properties, including deadlock
                  freedom.},

@ARTICLE{KokkeSW20:on-plfa,
  abstract   = {One of the leading textbooks for formal methods is Software
                  Foundations (SF), written by Benjamin Pierce in collaboration
                  with others, and based on Coq. After five years using SF in
                  the classroom, we came to the conclusion that Coq is not the
                  best vehicle for this purpose, as too much of the course needs
                  to focus on learning tactics for proof derivation, to the cost
                  of learning programming language theory. Accordingly, we have
                  written a new textbook, Programming Language Foundations in
                  Agda (PLFA). PLFA covers much of the same ground as SF,
                  although it is not a slavish imitation. What did we learn from
                  writing PLFA? First, that it is possible. One might expect
                  that without proof tactics that the proofs become too long,
                  but in fact proofs in PLFA are about the same length as those
                  in SF. Proofs in Coq require an interactive environment to be
                  understood, while proofs in Agda can be read on the page.
                  Second, that constructive proofs of preservation and progress
                  give immediate rise to a prototype evaluator. This fact is
                  obvious in retrospect but it is not exploited in SF (which
                  instead provides a separate normalise tactic) nor can we find
                  it in the literature. Third, that using extrinsically-typed
                  terms is far less perspicuous than using intrinsically-typed
                  terms. SF uses the former presentation, while PLFA presents
                  both; the former uses about 1.6 as many lines of Agda code as
                  the latter, roughly the golden ratio. The textbook is written
                  as a literate Agda script, and can be found here:

@ARTICLE{KokkeMP19:dhcp,
  abstract   = {We present Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP), a revised
                  interpretation of the "Proofs as Processes" correspondence
                  between linear logic and the œÄ-calculus initially proposed by
                  Abramsky [1994], and later developed by Bellin and Scott
                  [1994], Caires and Pfenning [2010], and Wadler [2014], among
                  others. HCP mends the discrepancies between linear logic and
                  the syntax and observable semantics of parallel composition in
                  the œÄ-calculus, by conservatively extending linear logic to
                  hyperenvironments (collections of environments, inspired by
                  the hypersequents by Avron [1991]). Separation of environments
                  in hyperenvironments is internalised by ‚äó and corresponds to
                  parallel process behaviour. Thanks to this property, for the
                  first time we are able to extract a labelled transition system
                  (lts) semantics from proof rewritings. Leveraging the
                  information on parallelism at the level of types, we obtain a
                  logical reconstruction of the delayed actions that Merro and
                  Sangiorgi [2004] formulated to model non-blocking I/O in the
                  œÄ-calculus. We define a denotational semantics for processes
                  based on Brzozowski derivatives, and uncover that
                  non-interference in HCP corresponds to Fubini‚Äôs theorem of
                  double antiderivation. Having an lts allows us to validate HCP
                  using the standard toolbox of behavioural theory. We
                  instantiate bisimilarity and barbed congruence for HCP, and
                  obtain a full abstraction result: bisimilarity, denotational
                  equivalence, and barbed congruence coincide.},

  abstract   = {We introduce a new formal semantic model for
                  annotating textual entailments that describes
                  restrictive, intersective, and appositive
                  modification. The model contains a formally defined
                  interpreted lexicon, which specifies the inventory
                  of symbols and the supported semantic operators, and
                  an informally defined annotation scheme that
                  instructs annotators in which way to bind words and
                  constructions from a given pair of premise and
                  hypothesis to the interpreted lexicon. We explore
                  the applicability of the proposed model to the
                  Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) 1‚Äì4 corpora and

                  based the manual annotation work. The constructions
                  we annotated were found to occur in 80.65\% of the
                  entailments in RTE 1‚Äì4 and were annotated with
                  cross-annotator agreement of 68\% on average. The
                  annotated parts of the RTE corpora are publicly

  abstract   = {We present StarChild and Lazuli, two libraries which leverage
                  refinement types to verify neural networks, implemented in F*
                  and Liquid Haskell. Refinement types are types augmented, or
                  refined, with assertions about values of that type, e.g.,
                  ``integers greater than five'', which are checked by an SMT
                  solver. Crucially, these assertions are written in the
                  language itself. A user of our library can refine the type of
                  neural networks, e.g., ``neural networks which are robust
                  against adversarial attacks'', and expect F* to handle the
                  verification of this claim for any specific network, without
                  having to change the representation of the network, or even
                  having to learn about SMT solvers.
                  Our initial experiments indicate that our approach could greatly reduce the
                  burden of verifying neural networks. Unfortunately, they also
                  show that SMT solvers do not scale to the sizes required for
                  neural network verification.},

                  capabilities of F* and Liquid Haskell, respectively, to verify
                  properties of pre-trained neural networks. We largely focus on
                  StarChild, as the F* syntax is slightly more concise, but

                  foundation for deadlock-free concurrent programming. However,
                  in previous work, there is a mismatch between the rules for
                  constructing proofs and the term constructors of the
                  œÄ-calculus: the fundamental operator for parallel composition
                  does not correspond to any rule of linear logic. Kokke et al.
                  (2019) introduced Hypersequent Classical Processes (HCP),
                  which addresses this mismatch using hypersequents (collections
                  of sequents) to register parallelism in the typing judgements.
                  However, the step from CP to HCP is a big one. As of yet, HCP
                  does not have reduction semantics, and the addition of delayed
                  actions means that CP processes interpreted as HCP processes

  abstract   = {In recent years, the interest in using proof
                  assistants to formalise and reason about mathematics
                  and programming languages has grown. Type-logical
                  grammars, being closely related to type theories and
                  systems used in functional programming, are a
                  perfect candidate to next apply this curiosity
                  to. The advantages of using proof assistants is that
                  they allow one to write formally verified proofs
                  about one‚Äôs type-logical systems, and that any
                  theory, once implemented, can immediately be
                  computed with. The downside is that in many cases
                  the formal proofs are written as an afterthought,
                  are incomplete, or use obtuse syntax. This makes it
                  that the verified proofs are often much more
                  difficult to read than the pen-and-paper proofs, and
                  almost never directly published. In this paper, we
                  will try to remedy that by example. Concretely, we
                  use Agda to model the Lambek-Grishin calculus, a
                  grammar logic with a rich vocabulary of typeforming
                  operations. We then present a verified procedure for
                  cut elimination in this system. Then we briefly
                  outline a continuation-passing style translation
                  from proofs in the Lambek-Grishin calculus to
                  programs in Agda. And finally, we will put our
                  system to use in the analysis of a simple example
                  sentence.},

                  dependently typed programming language

                  search tactic for first-order Agda terms. As a
                  result, writing proof automation tactics need not be
                  different from writing any other program. },

                  restrictive, intersective and appositive
                  modification. The model contains a formally defined
                  interpreted lexicon, which specifies the inventory
                  of symbols and the supported semantic operators, and
                  an informally defined annotation scheme that
                  instructs annotators in which way to bind words and
                  constructions from a given pair of premise and
                  hypothesis to the interpreted lexicon. We explore
                  the applicability of the proposed model to the
                  Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) 1-4 corpora and
                  describe a first-stage annotation scheme based on
                  which manual annotation work was carried out. The
                  constructions we annotated were found to occur in
                  80.65\% of the entailments in RTE 1-4 and were
                  annotated with cross-annotator agreement of 68\% on
                  average. The annotated RTE corpora are publicly
                  available for the research community. },

                  inferential phenomena in entailment data, buttressed
                  by a formal semantic model and a proof-system that
                  provide immediate verification of the coherency and
                  completeness of the marked annotations. By
                  integrating a web-based user interface, a formal
                  lexicon, a lambda-calculus engine and an
                  off-the-shelf theorem prover, the platform allows
                  human annotators to mark linguistic phenomena in
                  entailment data (pairs made up of a premise and a
                  hypothesis) and to receive immediate feedback
                  whether their annotations are substantiated: for
                  positive entailment pairs, the system searches for a
                  formal logical proof that the hypothesis follows
                  from the premise; for negative pairs, the system
                  verifies that a counter-model can be
                  constructed. This novel approach facilitates the
                  creation of textual entailment corpora with
                  annotations that are sufficiently coherent and
                  complete for recognizing the entailment relation or
                  lack thereof. A corpus of several hundred annotated
                  entailments is currently being compiled based on the
                  platform and will be available for the research

                  provide a foundation for deadlock-free concurrent programming,

                  introduce $CD_{NP}$, which extends CP with a novel account of
                  non-determinism. Our approach draws on bounded linear logic to
                  provide a strongly-typed account of standard process calculus
                  expressions of non-determinism. We show that our extension is
                  expressive enough to capture many uses of non-determinism in
                  untyped calculi, such as non-deterministic choice, while
                  preserving CP's meta-theoretic properties, including deadlock
