            <p>Today, we’re gonna talk about <em>conlangs</em>! Conlang is short for <em>constructed language</em>. There’s a bunch of famous conlangs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> is probably the most famous of the idealistic “let’s unite the world” conlangs—it’s pretty old, going back to the late 1870s. In the 1930s, some dude named Jerry Tolkien published a whole series of fantasy novels just to popularise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya" title="Quenya"><span class="font-tengwar" name="quenya">z$5h#</span></a><a href="/2021/06/15/a-tale-of-three-constructed-languages/#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and his other conlangs, an effort we can say was at least passably successful. In recent decades, we got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language" title="Klingon">tlhIngan Hol</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dothraki_language" title="Dothraki">lekh dothraki</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valyrian_languages" title="High Valyrian">Valyrio udrir</a>, each of which now have communities of speakers formed around them. Heck, two of those even got their’s own <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/tlh/en/Learn-Klingon">DuoLingo</a> <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/course/hv/en/Learn-High%20Valyrian">course</a>!<a href="/2021/06/15/a-tale-of-three-constructed-languages/#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Unfortunately, one thing all these languages share is that they were created by dudes…</p>

            <p>This post is a continuation of <em><a href="/2016/03/16/constraint-grammar-can-count/">Constraint Grammar can count!</a></em>, in which I talked a bunch about how expressive constraint grammar is. Now, for most of that post, what I actually meant was the fragment of constraint grammar where you only use the <code>REMOVE</code> rule.<a href="/2017/05/15/visl-cg-3-is-the-new-assembler/#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> However, I always had the suspicion that I’d be pretty easy to simulate a Turing machine using only the <code>ADDCOHORT</code> and <code>REMCOHORT</code> commands, treating the list of cohorts as the Turing machine’s tape—and I don’t think I was the only one to feel that way.</p>

            <p>One of my favourite card games is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/929/great-dalmuti">The Great Dalmuti</a>. It’s a variant of a widely-played card game with many, many names: President, Scumbag, Kings and Arseholes. Each of these may have <em>slightly</em> different rules, and <em>slightly</em> different decks, but they are all more or less the same game.</p>
            <p>I’ve had a bunch of discussions about this game over the years, most of which were about the possible strategies. Personally, I don’t believe that this game is all that hard to play well—and consequently, that it isn’t all that hard to write an AI for it. Pehaps even a very simple, rule-based AI can play passably. However, friends of mine think that it is a much harder problem, and that much more advanced techniques will be needed. Therefore, I thought I’d write a little playground for AIs to play in.</p>

            <p>Quite a while ago, <a href="https://github.com/UnicornPower">UnicornPower</a> introduced me to a game called <em>Breadbox</em>. It’s an experimental cousin of <em>20 Questions</em>, also known as <em>Plenty Questions</em>, which is played by two players—or more, really—who we’ll name Allie and Blake:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Allie thinks of something.</li>
            <li>As their first question, Blake asks <em>“Is it a breadbox?”</em></li>
            <li>Allie—who, seeing the mandatory first question, obviously wouldn’t choose a breadbox—answers <em>“No, it’s not!”</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>From there on out, all Blake’s questions have to be of the form…</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>“Is it more like a breadbox, or more like…?”</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>…where <em>breadbox</em> is replaced by whatever the current guess is, and the dots are filled in with whatever Blake wants. Let’s see if we can write an AI for playing this game!</p>

            <p>Previously, I mentioned that one of the most common posts on Agda blogs is implementing the simply-typed λ-calculus. <a href="https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/2013-05-01-simply_typed_lambda_calculus_in_agda,_without_shortcuts/">Gergő Érdi</a> even goes as far as to call it the FizzBuzz of dependently-typed programming, and rightfully so: If you do a quick search, you’ll find dozens of examples.</p>
            <p>In <em><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf">Dependently-Typed Programming with Agda</a></em>, Ulf Norell implements a type checker the simply-typed λ-calculus; <a href="http://mazzo.li/posts/Lambda.html">Francesco Mazzoli</a> more or less follows Ulf, but extends his λ-calculus with a primitive operator for addition; and, Gergő Érdi extends Ulf’s approach with a checker for scope and binding.</p>
            <p>I figured it would be more fun if, instead of rewriting the type checker example, I would do something a little bit different. So for my λ-calculus post, I’ll have a look at kinds of different ways of implementing the simply-typed λ-calculus. Today, natural deduction and the sequent calculus.</p>

            <p>Constraint grammar—it is a natural language processing formalism with great two distinctions: it routinely scores amongst the highest in tasks such as part-of-speech tagging and word-sense disambiguation, with F-scores at around 99%; and it has made some of the most dubious choices in programming language syntax in history. Though its specification has changed tremendously since CG1, it is nontheless a grammar formalism which sees a lot of usage. One natural question to ask of any grammar formalism is “how expressive is it?”</p>
            <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://github.com/inariksit">inariksit</a> visited me, and we decided to find out!</p>
